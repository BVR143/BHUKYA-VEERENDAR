## ðŸš€ About Me
### BHUKYA VEERENDAR 
My name is BHUKYA VEERENDAR, and I am currently a senior undergraduate student from the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at IIT Kanpur. In terms of my professional experience, I recently worked as a Business Analyst Intern at Finlatics, where I had the opportunity to collaborate with cross-functional teams on various case-based business projects aimed at improving business profitability. Apart from that, I have completed various projects during my college coursework to showcase my skills in Statistical Analysis, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning with the aim of transitioning my career into Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. My technical skills include Python and SQL as programming languages. Additionally, I am familiar with machine learning and deep learning libraries such as Scikit Learn, TensorFlow, and data visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn. During my time as a Student Guide at the Open House Event, IIT Kanpur, I had the opportunity to guide 50 students. This experience significantly enhanced my leadership and communication skills. Also, being a part of the NCC and a cricketer in the Telugu Premier League at IIT Kanpur, I understand the importance of responsibility, teamwork, and time management as well.

Let's connect! I would like to collaborate, learn, and contribute to the era of Data science and Artificial Intelligence. I am actively looking for an opportunities that allow me to apply my skills and grow in a challenging and supportive environment
